Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no DOLLARS
in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on SAFE HAVEN, I thought I would RUN about
a little and see the SLIMY part of the YACHT. It is a way I have of driving off the
POTATO and regulating circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the ROUNDABOUT;
whenever it is a LUDICROUS, SUSPICIOUS November in my HUMBLE ABODE; whenever I find myself involuntarily
BREAKING before coffin DANCE, and bringing up the rear of every PINEAPPLE I meet; and
especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a EXQUISITE
moral principle to prevent me from deliberately SKYDIVING into the TRAMPOLINE, and methodically
INCINERATE people's HOUSES off—then, I account it high time to get to LAMBORGHINI as soon as I can.
There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all PERSONS in their degree,
some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the SHRINE with me.
This is my second commit. I am getting the hang of it for sure!
This is my third commit. I'm a coding genius!

This is my edit FROM HOME.

This is step 10. FIRST COMMIT! Gee, Notepad++ is a cool text editor! I hope I do good on this quiz.

This is step 10, once again! I actually like coding now, for some reason I was kind of reluctant to learn because
it just feels like a lot. But really, I learned a lot about git bash and the whole workflow through repetition. SECOND COMMIT!
